# 📘 Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## 🧭 Introduction

Welcome to the **Requirement Analysis** repository! This project explores the fundamental phase of **Requirement Analysis** in the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**. Here, you’ll find insights into the process of gathering, documenting, and validating software requirements to ensure that the developed system meets business needs and user expectations.

## 🔍 What is Requirement Analysis?

**Requirement Analysis** is the process of identifying, documenting, and validating the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a new or modified software product. It ensures that the software development process aligns with business goals, user needs, and technical constraints.

This phase is crucial because it forms the foundation for subsequent stages such as design, development, testing, and delivery. It helps prevent misunderstandings and costly rework down the line.

## ❗ Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

1. **Prevents Scope Creep**
   - Clear and well-documented requirements help avoid changes or additions to the project that weren’t part of the original plan.

2. **Improves Communication**
   - Acts as a bridge between stakeholders and developers, ensuring that everyone has a shared understanding of the system’s needs.

3. **Reduces Cost and Time**
   - Identifying issues and gaps in the requirements early prevents costly revisions during later stages of the development cycle.

## 🛠️ Key Activities in Requirement Analysis

The key activities involved in Requirement Analysis are as follows:

- **Requirement Gathering**
  - Collecting information from stakeholders through methods like interviews, questionnaires, and workshops.
  
- **Requirement Elicitation**
  - Extracting detailed needs, expectations, and constraints from stakeholders.

- **Requirement Documentation**
  - Creating formal documentation such as the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) that clearly articulates the system's requirements.
  
- **Requirement Analysis and Modeling**
  - Analyzing and structuring requirements using models, diagrams, and flowcharts.
  
- **Requirement Validation**
  - Ensuring that the documented requirements are clear, complete, and testable.

## 🧩 Types of Requirements

### **Functional Requirements**
> Functional requirements describe what the system should do.

**Examples for a Booking Management System:**
- Users should be able to search available bookings by date.
- Admins should be able to add, update, or remove listings.
- The system must allow users to make payments through a secure payment gateway.

### **Non-functional Requirements**
> Non-functional requirements describe how the system should behave under certain conditions.

**Examples for a Booking Management System:**
- The system should respond within 3 seconds during peak traffic.
- The booking data must be stored securely using encryption.
- The user interface should be accessible to users with disabilities (WCAG 2.1 compliance).

## 🗂️ Use Case Diagrams

Use Case Diagrams visually represent the interactions between actors (users or systems) and the system itself.

### 🎯 Benefits of Use Case Diagrams:
- Visualize the interactions between users and the system.
- Identify the system's scope and boundaries.
- Help in validating system requirements and ensuring comprehensive functionality.

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

Acceptance Criteria define the conditions that a product or feature must meet to be accepted by a user, customer, or system.

### 📌 Why Acceptance Criteria are Important:
- Define what “done” means for each feature.
- Ensure that features are testable and meet the stakeholders' expectations.
- Prevent ambiguity in feature implementation, making it easier for developers to understand and deliver functionality.

### 🧾 Example: *Checkout Feature* for Booking System
- **Given** a user is logged in,
- **When** they add a booking to the cart and proceed to checkout,
- **Then** the system should calculate the total cost, apply applicable discounts, and securely redirect to the payment gateway.
